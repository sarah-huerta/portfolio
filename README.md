#### I am pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology with a focus on learning SQL and Database Management Skills. I am currently located in the Florida Panhandle, but am willing to travel across the state for work.

#### As a senior at Florida State University, I am pursuing a degree in Information Technology with an elective focus in Database Management and Architecture.

*Below you will find current and past projects I have developed during my time at Florida State.*

#### [LIS4369: Extensible Enterprise Solutions](lis4369/README.md)
    * Course Description: Employing skills to work within proprietary and nonproprietary Web application frameworks allow developers to build dynamic web sites and web applications in conjunction with data repositories and XML web services. This course will utilize industry-standard tools and techniques to create enterprise- class web applications.
    * Course Objectives
      * Utilize algorithms studied to perform common tasks, such as finding the max and min of a data set, counting, summing, tracking a previous value, searching and sorting, reading until EOF, etc;
      * Design and employ databases to build professional quality, data-driven applications, using proprietary and open source technologies and Employ user interfaces to read from and write to databases;


#### [LIS4381: Advanced Mobile Web Applications](lis4381/README.md)
    * Course Description: This course focuses on concepts and best practices for managing mobile technology projects. It covers processes and requirements for developing mobile applications and principles for effective interface and user experience design. Students develop a prototype of a mobile app and prepare a proposal and other documentation for communicating contractual and functional specifications to clients. Students also examine different issues and concerns that may influence the wide-spread adoption and implementation of mobile applications.
    * Course Objectives
      * Develop “mobile first” applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, XML, Java skills, client- as well as server-side skills, and data repository interfaces;
      * Use industry standard design architectures when creating mobile applications, Utilize current development tools and APIs to build mobile applications, and Review and analyze mobile hardware and software limitations based upon current literature

#### [LIS3781: Advanced Database Management ](lis3781/README.md)
    * Course Description: This course explores various topics in database management systems (DBMS), using a typical commercial DMBS (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle), as well as non-relational data repositories (aka “NoSQL” databases). Administration, Security, stored procedures, triggers, transactions, functions, data mining, data analytics, data warehousing, and remote access to databases are some of the topics covered. The student is expected to demonstrate an understanding of these database concepts through creating, deploying, and utilizing various relational database designs.
    * Course Objectives
      *  Perform advanced relational data modeling, using Entity-Relationship diagrams. Design a data warehouse.
      *  Apply performance tuning techniques
      *  Administer and perform backup and recovery procedures.
      *  Justify and define user’s roles, permissions, and access-levels as a database administrator. Create database security settings.
      *  Demonstrate an understanding of data warehousing, data mining, and data analytic techniques.

#### [LIS4368: Advanced Web Application](lis4368/README.md)
    * Course Description:This course provides a foundation in developing web applications with an emphasis on server-side concepts, tools and methods. Topics include basic web application programming, advanced object- oriented (OOP) and web application development utilizing Tomcat and Java Servlets.
    * Cource Objectives
      * Demonstrate the ability to program and deploy client/server-side scripts
      * Describe web-based input and output processes
      * Demonstrate web application to data source connectivity
      * Develop a dynamic web application using a mix of front-end and back-end web technologies
      * Employ OOP techniques, as well as business logic using a strongly typed language.
      * Create client- and server-side data validation.

  #### [LIS4761: Data Mining and Analytics(lis4761/README.md)
      * Course Description:This course provides basic concepts and essential algorithms for data analytics, including data cleaning, association rule mining, data warehousing, predictive modeling, clustering, and text mining. It also gives students an introduction to data analytics, which is defined as the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, predictive and exploratory models to drive decisions and actions
      * Course Objectives
        * Use data analytics tools with a graphical user interface (e.g., Weka and Orange Data Mining) to perform basic data analytics tasks such as clustering, association rule mining, classification, visualization, and text mining.
        * Interpret the results of data analytics while acknowledging their limitations
        * Explain and use prominent algorithms in data analytics, including predictive analytics, clustering, association rule mining, text mining, and visual analytics.
        * Use data analytics tools with a graphical user interface (e.g., Weka and Orange Data Mining) and Python in Jupyter Notebook to perform basic data analytics tasks such as clustering, association rule mining, classification.
