This course will utilize industry-standard tools and techniques to create enterprise- class web applications.
    * Course Objectives
      * Utilize algorithms studied to perform common tasks, such as finding the max and min of a data set, counting, summing, tracking a previous value, searching and sorting, reading until EOF, etc;
      * Design and employ databases to build professional quality, data-driven applications, using proprietary and open source technologies and Employ user interfaces to read from and write to databases;


#### [LIS4381: Advanced Mobile Web Applications](lis4381/README.md)
    * Course Description: This course focuses on concepts and best practices for managing mobile technology projects. It covers processes and requirements for developing mobile applications and principles for effective interface and user experience design. Students develop a prototype of a mobile app and prepare a proposal and other documentation for communicating contractual and functional specifications to clients. Students also examine different issues and concerns that may influence the wide-spread adoption and implementation of mobile applications.
    * Course Objectives
      * Develop “mobile first” applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, XML, Java skills, client- as well as server-side skills, and data repository interfaces;
      * Use industry standard design architectures when creating mobile applications, Utilize current development tools and APIs to build mobile applications, and Review and analyze mobile hardware and software limitations based upon current literature

#### [LIS4381: Advanced Database Management ](lis3781/README.md)
    * Course Description: This course explores various topics in database management systems (DBMS), using a typical commercial DMBS (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle), as well as non-relational data repositories (aka “NoSQL” databases). Administration, Security, stored procedures, triggers, transactions, functions, data mining, data analytics, data warehousing, and remote access to databases are some of the topics covered. The student is expected to demonstrate an understanding of these database concepts through creating, deploying, and utilizing various relational database designs.
    * Course Objectives
      *  Perform advanced relational data modeling, using Entity-Relationship diagrams. Design a data warehouse.
      *  Apply performance tuning techniques
      *  Administer and perform backup and recovery procedures.
      *  Justify and define user’s roles, permissions, and access-levels as a database administrator. Create database security settings.
      *  Demonstrate an understanding of data warehousing, data mining, and data analytic techniques.
